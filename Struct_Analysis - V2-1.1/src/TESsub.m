function S = TESsub(sm,f,p)
%S = TESsub(SM.X,fidx,0);
% FindTES -  finds either all Minimal Test Equation Sets and Minimal Test
% Sets in a structural model or all Test Equation Sets and Test Sets in a
% structural model
%
%     S = TESsub(sm,f,p)
%
%  Inputs:
%    sm     - 0/1-matrix representing the structure of the unknown signals.
%    f      - row vector, where f(i) = j means that fault j is included in 
%             the equation corresponding to the i:te row in sm. f(i) = 0
%             means that no fault is included in equation i. It is assumed
%             the each fault only enters in one equation.
%    p      - logical variable, where P = 0 means only minimal TES and TS
%             should be included in the output S.   
%   
%
%  Output:
%    S.eq   - cell array of TES or MTES represented as index sets. 
%    S.f    - cell array of TS or MTS represented as index sets.
%    S.sr   - vector with the structural redundancy of each TES or MTES.
