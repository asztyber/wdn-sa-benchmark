function [row_over,col_over,sr]=Mp(sm)
%   Computes the overdetermined part of a structural
%              matrix. 
%
%    [row_over,col_over]=Mp(sm)
%
%  Inputs:
%    sm  - A biadjacency matrix. 
%
%  Output:
%    row_over   - The row indices of the overdetermined part. 
%    col_over   - The column indices of the overdetermined part.
%    sr         - Structural Redundancy
